# Main Idea
- The primary objective is to bring together students and their projects exclusively from various colleges, universities, schools, and institutions.
- Students can register and log in, or they can try the demo user to explore all available projects.
- Form Teams: Assign Team Leaders and Team Members.
- Create Projects: Specify Project Details, Deadline, Technology Stack, and Progress.
- Create Tasks: Team leaders can assign tasks to everyone, while members can self-assign tasks.
- View all projects and their details created by students across Bharat.

# Modules
## Teams
Teams are made up of members, and every team has a leader. Team leaders have
special privileges like being able to assign tasks to other team members and
changing the members of the team. 

## Projects
Every project is assigned to a team and thus has members and a leader associated
with it. A project can only be assigned to one team but a team can have many
projects. Once a project is over it can be marked as completed.

## Tasks
Tasks are assigned to projects. Once a task has been assigned to a project it
can be assigned to a member of the project's team, it will then appear on a list
of their active tasks. Tasks can be assigned by team members to themselves or by
the team leader to anyone on the team. Any member of a project's team can create
a task for the project. Every task is given a unique number that can be used to
refer to it independent of the project or user it is assigned to. Tasks can also
be marked as completed, this is generally done by the user that the task is
assigned to, but may also be done by the team leader.

## The Dashboard
One of the main features of the site is the user's dashboard.
Currently this shows six key tables, though this may change in the
future.

### 1 & 2 ) Graphs
There are two graphs , 1st one shows technologies used in all projects and the 2nd one shows all active v/s completed projects.
Note: Graph data is independent of user, i.e it shows graphs for all available projects in database.

### 3) Top tasks
This is a list of the user's top seven tasks, tasks are ranked firstly by due
date and then by priority (in other words the highest priority task that is due
today is at the top).

### 4) Unassigned tasks
A list of the top seven unassigned tasks from projects where the user is the
team leader, again sorted by due date and priority.

### 5) User's projects
A list of all active projects the user is a part of.

### 6) User's teams
A list of teams the user is a part of.
